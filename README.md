# logseq-capature-gnome

This is a Python script that shows a textarea with which you can capture a note for Logseq.

This uses the Logseq HTTP API to send a note to Logseq.

You can use `Escape` to close the window without sending a note. And you can use `<Control>Return` to 
send the note to Logseq.
